How to Use it:

3) Double click on:
   
   a) Windows: Double clik on init_win64.bat or init_win64.bat.exe
   
   b) Linux: Install nw globally [instructions for nw.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js) ( is pretty easy )
   
   c) Mac: It doesn't run, but It should. Appreciate any collaboration on this, probably has something to do with paths?. Also, Front Ninja contains an .apk file, wich is an android App, It should be possible to create an Ios App just by compiling frontninja/app/mobile/www folder with phonegap but I don't have an Iphone, a mac nor a Ios developer license :´(

A Front end editor, includes:

1 - Server: node js.
2 - Sass compiler: live sass compiler, change scss file and view new styles in the browser without reloading the page.
3 - Partial system: Handlebars syntax allow to include files and much more.
